## Project Item catalog

Flask project for Udaicty fullstack course implemented acording to requirements.

## Requirements

This script is written to run inside vagrant with the FSDN-virtual machine setup found [here](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)

## Instructions

Login to the vagrant machine.

I have included a catalog.db file with this project for testing.

To test with a blank database either delete or make a backup of catalog.db.

Run the db_setup.py to setup the database model.

`python db_setup.py`

To start the web server on port 5000 run the project.py file.

`python project.py`
